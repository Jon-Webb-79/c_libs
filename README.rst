This library contains C functions and generic operators that enable pre-defined data structures,
generic print statements, random number generators, and file readers.  This library implements
generic operators to simplify the user interface.  Unlike traditional macros, a generic operator
does not consume extra memory, or increase the speed of code execution.  Instead a generic operator
only provides a generic type agnostic interface for all users of the library.
